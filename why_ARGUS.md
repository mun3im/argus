## 🌿 The Three Layers of ARGUS  

| Layer | Meaning | Significance  |
|-------|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Ornithological** | **Great Argus** (*Argusianus argus*)<br>• Spectacular pheasant native to Malay Peninsula & Borneo<br>• Males display 100+ "eyes" on wing feathers during courtship<br>• IUCN Near Threatened (habitat loss) | ✅ **Native to Malaysia, target deployment region**<br>✅ **"Hundred eyes" mirrors gatekeeper vigilance**<br>✅ **Conservation flagship species**—your system protects birds like this |
| **Mythological** | **Argus Panoptes**<br>Greek guardian with 100 eyes who never slept | ✅ **Perpetual vigilance** = M4 gatekeeper's 3s wake cycles<br>✅ **Eyes that never all close** = tiered architecture (M4 always watching) |
| **Engineering** | **A**utonomous **R**emote **G**uardian for **U**ltra-low-power **S**pecies monitoring | ✅ **Gatekeeper-centric** architecture explicitly named<br>✅ Technically precise yet poetic |

### Scientific & Cultural Resonance
- **Biogeographic alignment**: Great Argus inhabits the *exact rainforests* where ARGUS biologgers deploy (Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo)
- **Conservation symmetry**: This system monitors biodiversity *including* species like the Great Argus—closing a poetic loop
- **Indigenous connection**: Known as *"Kuang Raja"* (King Pheasant) in Malay—honors local ecological knowledge

> *"The Great Argus displays 100 eye-like ocelli on its wings—a natural embodiment of perpetual vigilance. This system, named for this bird, now *becomes* the forest's guardian: watching with electronic eyes so the real Argus may thrive undisturbed."*
> Like its namesake bird watching over the canopy, ARGUS stands guard for biodiversity—ensuring no bird call goes unheard.
